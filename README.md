## Have you seen cubinger?

This our entry for the gamejam **Bullet Hell Jam 2021**, with the theme **10 SECONDS**.
For this gamejam, we decided to do mashup between a platform, puzzle and bullet hell, lost in the riiples of time. *Con you helps us find our cat?*

It was a great fun to do, and, while not complete, we are still proud of it. Enjoy our code!
