## Have you seen cubinger?

### The main idea of the game is:
* Neils Cuboid steals the cat, cubinger, from the renowned Altert Cubestein, because it is the living proof of the Theory of General Relativity.
* By doing so, and because the cat is really a Time Lord, the lab becomes unstable, and levels scattered in space/time.
* The only way to reach each level, and thus save cubinger, is to pass thru space/time portals, which connect each level
* Each portal last 10sec
* Each level is garded by crazy turrets
* The player can manipulate time by catching some powerups

### Type of game
* Crossy-road like game
* ISO + ORTHO
* Level floating in space
